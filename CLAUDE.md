# TradeLikeMe Platform — Claude Context

## What Is This Project
TradeLikeMe is a verified-strategy trading marketplace. Users deposit funds, a proven agent trades on their behalf using a human-cloned strategy with 89% win rate. Platform takes 20% profit share. Zero fees, zero subscriptions.

**This repo** (`abrarnasirjaffari/tradelikeme`) = Python backend platform only.
**Separate repo** (`abrarnasirjaffari/tradelikeme-website`) = Next.js website + dashboard. Already built. Will be linked to this platform later. Do NOT touch it from here.

## What To Build Next Session
Start with accounts/API keys (tasks A1–A20 in tasks.md), then scaffold the folder structure (R1–R10), then Python environment (P1–P15), then begin the Anchor vault program (V1+).

---

## Architecture Summary

### This Platform Does
- Python asyncio trading agent (strategy logic, zone scanning, trade execution)
- Custom Anchor vault program on Solana (on-chain profit split)
- FastAPI backend (REST API + WebSocket for website to consume)
- Multi-strategy isolation (each strategy = separate agent process + separate SQLite DB + separate Docker container)
- Multi-channel notifications (Telegram + WhatsApp Phase 1, more later)

### This Platform Does NOT Do
- Frontend / UI (that's tradelikeme-website)
- Forex (on hold — research needed)
- CEX clients in Phase 1 (post-hackathon — focus is Solana first)

---

## Exchange Layer

### Solana (Phase 1 — hackathon priority)
| Protocol | SDK | Coins | Leverage | Priority |
|----------|-----|-------|----------|----------|
| Raydium Perps | `raydium-sdk` | 70+ | 50x | 1st (primary) |
| Jupiter Perps | `@jup-ag/perps-sdk` | BTC/SOL/ETH | 250x | 2nd (fallback) |
| Third protocol | TBD | TBD | TBD | Research needed (Drift removed — hacked) |

- **Price oracle**: Pyth Network WebSocket (shared by all Solana protocols)
- **RPC**: Helius (free tier, ~5% usage)
- **Wallet**: Phantom Connect (email sign-in, hackathon sponsor) + @solana/wallet-adapter
- **Stablecoin**: CASH + USDC
- **Auth**: BetterAuth (sessions, social login, 2FA, roles)

### CEX (Phase 2 — post hackathon)
WEEX, Bybit, BingX, Binance, Bitget — all via `exchange_base.py` abstraction

### Forex (On Hold)
Research needed before any integration

---

## Anchor Vault Program (CORE — start here)

Custom Solana smart contract. ~300-400 lines Rust/Anchor. This is what makes TradeLikeMe trustless and wins the hackathon.

**4 instructions:**
1. `deposit()` — user sends USDC/CASH to vault PDA
2. `delegate_to_protocol()` — vault authorizes agent to trade (trade only, NEVER withdraw)
3. `settle_epoch()` — called by agent monthly, auto-splits 20% profit to platform wallet on-chain
4. `withdraw()` — user pulls their balance anytime

**Vault PDA seeds**: `[b"vault", user_pubkey, strategy_id]` — one vault per (user × strategy)

**Profit settlement rules:**
- Agent calls `settle_epoch()` every month automatically
- Contract calculates: closing balance − opening balance = profit
- 20% of profit → platform wallet (on-chain, automatic, trustless)
- 80% stays in vault — user can compound freely
- User withdraws whenever they want — we never touch their principal or 80% share
- If user compounds → next epoch profit calculated on larger balance → we still take 20%

---

## Multi-Strategy Isolation

Each strategy = isolated sandbox:
- Own Python agent process
- Own SQLite database (`strategy_{id}.db`)
- Own Solana sub-account / vault
- Own sentinel (WebSocket watcher)
- Own Docker container (Dokploy)

FastAPI routes requests by `strategy_id + user_id`. Zero cross-strategy access.

---

## Strategy Architecture

### Hybrid Config Model
- Core logic → Python class per strategy (`SDZoneStrategy`, `StrategyB`, etc.)
- Tuneable params → SQLite row (coins, leverage, risk modes, SL%, TP zones, session hours)
- All inherit `BaseStrategy` abstract class
- All call `ExchangeBase` abstract methods — same code runs on Solana, CEX, Forex

### Our Strategy — S/D Zone Trading
- Entry: Supply/Demand zone reversal
- TF stack: 1M → 1W → 1D → 4H → 1H → 30M → 15M
- BTC 1D gate: no alt entries against BTC direction
- 4H zone gate: lower-TF zones need 4H zone within ±5%
- SL: structural body-close (30m candle body, not wick). Wick past SL = stop hunt = IGNORE
- TP1: 50% qty at zone 1. TP2: 50% qty at zone 2. Never zone 3-4.
- Disaster SL on exchange: structural + 3% buffer (fires only if sentinel dies)
- Max 2 concurrent positions. Min balance $35.

### Zone Scanning
- **Primary**: KLineChart + Playwright → OHLCV from exchange → render chart → screenshot → Claude Opus 4.6 analysis
- **Fallback**: TradingView MCP (if KLineChart unavailable)
- Claude model: Opus 4.6 via **AWS Bedrock** (not Anthropic direct API)
- AWS credentials: IAM user `claude-code-bedrock`, region `us-east-1`

---

## Database Architecture

```
platform.db          ← shared: users, auth sessions, strategy registry, notification prefs
strategy_sd.db       ← isolated: trades, positions, journal, epochs for S/D zone strategy
strategy_b.db        ← isolated: trades, positions, journal, epochs for strategy B
```

FastAPI reads `platform.db` for auth, routes queries to the correct `strategy_{id}.db`.

---

## Notifications

### Phase 1 (build now)
- Telegram (Bot API)
- WhatsApp (Twilio sandbox → production Meta Cloud API later)

### Architecture
```
sentinel / trade_agent
        ↓
    notifier.py  ← unified dispatcher (asyncio.gather)
        ├── channels/telegram.py
        └── channels/whatsapp.py
```

### Event Types
`ZONE_TOUCH`, `TRADE_ENTERED`, `TP1_HIT`, `TP2_HIT`, `SL_HIT`, `BALANCE_LOW`, `AGENT_DOWN`, `DAILY_SUMMARY`

---

## FastAPI Backend

### Public endpoints (website calls, JWT required)
- `GET /strategies` — list strategies with stats
- `GET /strategies/{id}` — strategy detail
- `POST /subscriptions` — subscribe to strategy
- `DELETE /subscriptions/{id}` — unsubscribe
- `GET /users/{id}/vaults` — user's vaults
- `GET /users/{id}/positions` — open positions
- `GET /users/{id}/trades` — trade history
- `GET /users/{id}/pnl` — P&L summary
- `POST /vaults/{id}/deposit` — deposit
- `POST /vaults/{id}/withdraw` — withdraw
- `GET|POST /users/{id}/risk-mode` — risk mode
- `GET|POST /notifications/config` — notification settings
- `POST /notifications/test` — test notification
- `WS /ws/live` — real-time push to dashboard

### Internal only
- `POST|GET /agent/{strategy_id}/start|stop|status`
- `POST /strategies` — add strategy (admin)
- `GET /admin/users|revenue`

---

## User Risk Modes
3 presets stored in `platform.db`, read by agent at runtime. UI is on the website.
- **Conservative**: low leverage, low margin, 20+ trade buffer
- **Medium**: balanced risk/reward
- **Aggressive**: high leverage, high margin, 4-5 trade buffer
Exact parameters TBD when we define strategy config.

---

## Deployment
- **Server**: AWS EC2 t3.xlarge (Singapore, already running)
- **PaaS**: Dokploy (self-hosted, install: `curl -sSL https://dokploy.com/install.sh | bash`)
- **Containers**: one Docker container per strategy agent + one for FastAPI
- **Routing**: Traefik auto-SSL → `api.tradelikeme.xyz` (FastAPI), `dash.tradelikeme.xyz` (Dokploy)
- **Config**: single `docker-compose.yml` in `infra/`

## Strategy Marketplace
- Traders submit via form on website (not this project)
- We review manually: TradingView verification, win rate check, strategy interview
- If approved: we build the agent instance ourselves and add to marketplace
- No self-serve automation
- Requirement: 50+ verified trades, 55%+ win rate minimum

---

## CEX Profit Settlement (Phase 2)
- Users send 20% manually (honour system for now)
- Automated enforcement to be built later
- Not a priority until Solana phase is complete

---

## Hackathon Info
- **Event**: Solana Frontier Hackathon — Colosseum / Solana Foundation
- **Period**: Apr 6 – May 11, 2026
- **Registration deadline**: May 4, 2026 (ACTION REQUIRED)
- **Prize target**: Grand Champion $30k or Standout $10k
- **Sponsors used**: Phantom Connect, CASH stablecoin, Helius RPC, Colosseum Copilot

## Key Rules For Claude
- Working directory for this project is always `F:/AgentTeam/hackathon/Platform/`
- Never touch files outside this folder
- Never push to `abrarnasirjaffari/AgentTeam` repo
- Never read or copy code from `F:/AgentTeam/trading_agent/` — start fresh
- Always commit + push after completing a meaningful unit of work
- tasks.md is the source of truth for what to build next — check it before starting
- plan.md has all architectural decisions — check it before making design choices
- Keep tasks.md updated as tasks are completed (check off done items)
